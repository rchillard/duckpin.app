# API
The same API surface is written in two different languages:
- NodeJS
- Python

## NodeJS

## Python
The Python version of this API is written using [Chalice](https://aws.github.io/chalice/index), a serverless microframework for running Python in AWS Lambda.

## Why?
When implementing the same thing across languages, it's easier to see the strengths and weaknesses of each.
