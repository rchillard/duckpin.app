# duckpin.app
[General Dwight D. Eisenhower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower) famously said, "I have two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important.  The urgent are not important, and the important are never ugent."  Duckpin.app is a web application for more efficient, systematic tracking of to do items.  This application uses the method of task prioritization established by the General in his Eisenhower Matrix, classifying tasks in two dimensions:
- Urgency
- Importance

You can read more about the [Eisenhower Matrix](https://jamesclear.com/eisenhower-box) or use the app to learn how it works.  The app's name is inspired by one of General Eisenhower's nicknames: [Duckpin](http://www.presidenteisenhower.net/), after a type of bowling that he favored.
