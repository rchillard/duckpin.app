# duckpin.app
Web application for more efficient, systematic tracking of to do items.  This application uses the method of task prioritization used by [General Dwight D. Eisenhower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower) and his Eisenhower Matrix, classifying tasks in two dimensions:
- Urgency
- Importance

You can read more about the [Eisenhower Matrix](https://jamesclear.com/eisenhower-box) or use the app to learn how it works.  The name is inspired by one of General Eisenhower's nicknames: [Duckpin](http://www.presidenteisenhower.net/), after a type of bowling that he favored.
